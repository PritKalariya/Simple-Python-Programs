These are basic python programs.

**Dictionary app**: Takes a `word` as user input and outputs a one-line `definition` for that word. It also suggests words if there is any typo error or word has no meaning.

**Password Generator**: Takes an integer as input for the size of password. Returns a password of the specified digits containing `characters`, `numbers` & `special symbols`.

**System Check**: Run the program and it will display the system details of the machine on which the program is running.

**TextPro**: It takes arguments from the user in the form of strings, contineuosly, unless the user enters `end`. It then, combines all the inputs to form a meaningful sentence.
